##DAY I
###(10/27/14)
-------

##Keynote by Jeffrey Zeldman ([@zeldman](http://twitter.com/zeldman))

###Opening Notes
- Twitter Hashtag: [#aeaorl](https://twitter.com/search?q=aeaorl&src=typd)

###Understanding Web Design
- There is a need to define clearer terms to describe what we do to people who aren't web developers.
- A need for interactive content vs. non-interactive content, and the importance of distinguishing the two.
- "The web is a ghetto for designers who aren't good enough for TV."
- Users don't care, they just want their stuff. Find out what they want and execute on that.
- "Web design is service design."
- "A great website makes interaction easy."
- "Great design is never passive, it is made to seem that way."

##Designing Engagement by Jaimee Newberry ([@jaimeejaimee](http://twitter.com/jaimeejaimee))

###Three Things to Designing Engagement
1. Personality:
	+ Little details:
		* Microcopy
		* Alert messages
		* App description
		* Release notes
		* Dialogue boxess
2. OnBoarding:
	+ Introducing the concept. Help them understand the value of the product.
		* [Square](http://squareup.com): "Accept Credit Cards Today"
		* [Medium](https://medium.com/about/welcome-to-medium-9e53ca408c48): "Tell Your Story"
	+ Be mindful. Tutorial screens. Important, but succinct.
		* [One Kings Lane](https://www.onekingslane.com): You can't view the site without an account. Don't roadblock people, don't make them sign up.
		* [Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com): Lots of opening info, but the choice to proceed without knowing everything is still there.
		* Video games are a great example of onboarding experiences.
3. Copy:
	+ Word choices are important.
		* Twitter. "What's happening?" vs. "What are you doing?", and how that makes users think differently about their interactions.
		* Use a copy framework:
			- For:
			- To say:
			- So they will:
			- Displayed via:
			- When:
			- Tone:
		* Mad libs style (and more useful!):
			- These words are for [purpose],
			to say [what is happening],
			so that they will [understand and engage].
			The words will be displayed via [message vehicle]
			when [user interaction point].
			The tone of these words should be [what fits your brand and personality].
		* Be mindful. Some people are annoyed by kitschy copy. Some people don't like to take everything seriously, either. Honesty is important.
	+ Review your copy!
		* Actual example. Paypal had an alert message with placeholder copy that _actually said_ "[insert crappy content here]"
	+ Set expectations:
		* [Jelly](https://jelly.co): "This answer is too wordy for Jelly. Please shorten it a bit? Thanks!" is ambiguous, because it doesn't define the expectations of the app.
		* App dialogue buttons should make sense in context. "Are you sure you want to cancel your delivery?" Cancel/OK are the options. What does "Cancel" imply in this context?
	+ "Come in and try the worst meatball sandwich that one guy on Yelp ever had IN HIS LIFE." - Spinning a poor experience from a customer into something playful and ultimately (and strangely) inviting.
	+ Meaningful error screens, and how they can be opportunities for engagement (e.g., [Flickr Coloring Contest](https://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/flickrcolourcontest)).

###Review your product.
- From time to time, it is necessary to make sure it is cohesive. Make it sure it embodies the three previous principles:
	1. Personality.
	2. OnBoarding.
	3. Copy.

##Designing Using Data by Sarah Parmenter ([@sazzy](http://twitter.com/sazzy))

###Being a good designer is no longer good enough.
- What is needed is why something should look a certain way.
- Responsive design is embracing function over form, and creates similar user experiences.
- Instincts are experiments. Data is proof.

###Bringing data (facts) to the table, it becomes less about emotions and more about the reality we operate in.
- Call data by what it is: Research.

###Why haven't we been designing with data?
- Old, outdated processes and politics?
- Adherence to self-affirming, ego-stroking conceits?

###"Data" is not thought of as part of a designer's job (but it really is).
- We tend to think about aesthetics, but we should ask why we do.
- Some data is better than no data whatsoever.

###Even large companies such as Mailchimp are only getting started to using data to inform their design decisions.
- EverNote for gathering feedback.

###"Nobody has an excuse to make an uninformed decision anymore."
- Use data to inform your decisions in your work.

###Intuition
- Do not necessarily discard gut instinct, but gather the data to affirm (to disprove) the validity of the instinct.
- [airbnb](http://airbnb.com)
	+ A study done with professionally shot photos, vs. unprofessional.  Professional shots were used, with rentals increasing significantly.
- "Designers go from decorators to problem solvers."

###Strategy and Analytical Tools
- "If a strategy can't predict outcomes, it is broken."
- Analytics Services:
	+ [GoSquared](https://www.gosquared.com)
	+ [Google Anayltics](http://google.com/analytics)
	+ [Mixpanel](https://mixpanel.com)
	+ [Gauges](http://get.gaug.es)
	+ [KISSMetrics](https://www.kissmetrics.com)
	+ [Tealium](http://tealium.com)
	+ [Chartbeat](https://chartbeat.com)
- Vanity Metrics (useless "data", used to inflate ego or affirm self-delusions)
	+ Hits (the more assets, the higher the hits. Why is that important?)
	+ Total signups (are they even active users?)
	+ Pageviews (only good for ad metrics).
	+ Number of visits (diversity? Probably not.)
	+ Unique visitors (what did they even do?)
	+ Counting social interactions (likes, follows, et cetera. Are they even engaged?)

###Track people and their habits.
- Paying customers, [conversions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conversion_marketing), interactions.
- Identify:
	+ Who are your customers?
		* Methods of identifying and reaching audiences:
			- [Segmentation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_segmentation).
			- [Targeting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Target_market).
		* Time of day, types of users, habits of those users.

###What Is The Common Link?
- Outstanding and remarkable people in ordinary industries and service providers.
- Opposing stagnation.
- Do not shy away from competition, go amongst the lions and do what you do better, or in a way that is more compelling.
- Consider testing potential consumers with promotional ideas, and use that to gather data on customers and attempt to develop relationships based on the data.

###Personas
- Rely on intuition to get started and then follow through with data to develop personas.
- Facebook advertising can actually provide significant data on who your customers are, and will break them down into finely detailed segmentation.
	+ And then use that segmentation to deliver personalized experiences.
- Be honest. If you fall flat, admit it and do what it takes to bring people back in the door.
	+ Users are exceptional at cutting through marketing speak.
- Every social media post NEEDS a call to action.
	+ Link inside of post.
	+ TrueSocialMetrics is a great app for social media interaction analytics.

###Referrer Loyalty
- Consider when you post to social media.

###Designed Processes.
- Streamlining processes specific to your business customer needs (booking, for instance, for a salon).

###UX
- What can you do for customers that may actually provide a real life use!
- Hearing the needs of your customers and giving them the ability to remedy their problems and speak their desires.

###Content
- Simple content changes can impart clarity. "See Highrise Plans and Pricing" vs. "Free Trial" (which may imply launching a long, inextricable process).
- Imagery in design (human-oriented) may impart a higher desire to participate.
	+ Overproduced photography can create a problem where users may assume stock photography).

###Patterns
- Some people have to come back multiple times before they convert.

###Iterative Working
- "Being flexible in your approach to design is what is really valuable."
- CrazyEgg shows a heatmap of interactions, only by dropping in a simple JS resource.
- Optimizely for A/B testing.
- Responsive hierarchy should be sequential across platforms.

###Human Language
- Identifying with people and keeping an open mind to the needs of customers, and turning that into data that arms you for future success.

-------

##Mobile First Responsive Design by Jason Grigsby ([@grigs](http://twitter.com/grigs))

###Cobrowsing
- User behavior where the user watches live programming while browsing related content
	+ Behavior is being picked up by large media outlets (e.g., ESPM)

###Performance is a Critical Piece of Design.
- A slow web site will cause people to have a negative perception of the product and brand.
	+ People demand websites to load as fast as possible (preferably within two seconds).
	+ Mobile users don't care if their mobile network is slow. They expect an experience as fast as a desktop, or on wifi.
	+ Shaving down image size (lossless compression)
	+ Using CDNs for common libraries.

###Responsive design for apps is inevitable
- Lines between device classes are blurring.
	+ Phones and tablets overlap frequently in terms of sizes, especially when orientation is invoked.
	+ Device sizes cannot be relied upon to build a responsive site.

###Reorder media queries to go from smaller screen sizes to larger ones.
- Keep your baseline styles outside of all media queries.
- Keep CSS images in their place.
	+ Images with display: none; are still downloaded!
	+ Keep images scoped within media queries to avoid unnecessary downloads.
		* Or, alternatively, use display: none; on the image's parent element.
	+ Using image-set() for multiple image sizes.

###Conditionally load JS based on screen size and capabilities.
- Use matchMedia JS to test media queries and bucket JS imports within.
	+ matchMedia also has a [polyfill for older browsers](https://github.com/paulirish/matchMedia.js).
- [AJAX Include Pattern](https://github.com/filamentgroup/Ajax-Include-Pattern)
	+ data-after links to the resource to pull in external content.
	+ data-media is the media query threshold to pull that content in.
- Off-Canvas menus to hide menu content when we don't need it on smaller screens.
- All of these are to abstract the media queries from the JS calls.

###Use multiple image sizes for different media sizes.
- Resolution switching.
- Art direction
	+ Cropping based on context
	+ Different images for different contexts.
- The [<picture> element](http://www.w3.org/TR/html-picture-element):
	+ Multiple sources, based on media query.
	+ <img> tag as the basic fallback, or use of srcset.
	+ Use <picture> for art direction.
	+ Use sizes="" and srcset="" for non-art direction implementations.
- [Picturefill](http://scottjehl.github.io/picturefill) as a last resort.
- Join the [Responsive Images Community Group (RICG)](http://responsiveimages.org)

###Handle high-density images with care.
- Use CSS for Retina images (image-set)
- SVG for vector graphics, when photography/raster imagery isn't necessary.
- High-resolution images have an effect on the perception of a product.
	+ Higher resolution has positive connotations.
	+ Lower resolution imparts a sense of cheapness, or lower quality.
- Use of compressive images, but can have an impact on device responsiveness.

###Eight Guidelines to Responsive Images
- Use SVGs whenever possible.
	+ Media Queries inside of SVG allow for the optimal presentation of content where scaling can have an adverse effect on the visibility of content.
- Encourage people to upload the highest quality source possible.
- Provide an automatic image resizing and compression service.
- Resize images with URL parameters (caching issues, unless used with pretty URLs).
- Provide automated output of picture and picturefill.
- Provide a way to override resized images for art direction needs.
- Integrate image compression best practices.
	+ [jpegtan](http://jpegclub.org/jpegtran)/[jpegoptim](https://github.com/tjko/jpegoptim)
	+ [OptiPNG](http://optipng.sourceforge.net/)/[PNGOUT](http://advsys.net/ken/utils.htm)
	+ Far future expires headers
	+ Learn from the [Google PageSpeed Module](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/module)
- Detect support for WebP image format and use it.
	+ Smaller than JPEG
	+ Compresses better than libpng and other lossless types.

##Putting Your UI in Motion With CSS by Val Head ([@vlh](http://twitter.com/vlh))

###[CSS Transforms](http://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/t/transform/)
- perspective
- scale
- skew
- rotate
- et cetera.

###[Transitions](http://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/t/transition)
- Apply a transition property to effect changes over an interval of time.
- Keyframes to describe when we want more complex animations.

###Animation softens the edges of interaction.
- Animation establishes location.
	+ [Wacom](http://wacom.com) site's navigation.
	+ [Google+](http://plus.google.com) hashtag exploration.
- Animation guides tasks:
	+ Can give input on whether or not tasks are being done correctly.
		* Signup forms.
		* Lists and other utilities.
- Animation demonstrates concepts:
	+ [Mailchimp](http://mailchimp.com) template authoring.
	+ InVision
	+ Tutorials!
- Animation tells your story.
	+ Interactive (or non-interactive) concepts to supplement copy.
- Animation gets (all the) attention.
	+ Fitbit uses animations to call out achievments and gain positive attention.

###Doing It With Style
- Keep UI Animations Flexible
	+ Animations shouldn't have to wait to finish to obey the last input from the user.
- Don't Create Obstacles
	+ [Nixon Watches](http://www.nixon.com/us/en) (correct).
	+ [Square](http://squareup.com) (incorrect, gets in the way).
- Prototype Your Ideas
- Look at Speed and Readability
	+ .2s to .6s for small interactions.
	+ Ease-outs feel more "responsive"
	+ Complex easing needs more time to be readable.
- Motion matches to your message

###New Features Are On The Horizon
- Visual editor for CSS transitions?
- Tweening libraries.

##The Map & The Territory by Ethan Marcotte ([@beep](http://twitter.com/beep))

###[Responsive Web Design](http://alistapart.com/article/responsive-web-design)
- An attempt to embrace the flexibility of the web, rather than try to exert control over it.
- The experience is _not_ defined by device constraints, but is rather fluid and infinite.

###Three Responsive Ingredients
1. Pixels, not proportions.
2. Flexible Images
3. Media Queries

###Fluid Grid
- Target / Context = Result
	+ Target Value (e.g., 278px)
	+ Context (Width of entire row, 888px)
	+ Result = 31.306306306306%

###[:nth-child](http://css-tricks.com/how-nth-child-works)
- A single element: nth-child(2)
- Multiple elements: nth-child(2n)
- Multiple elements with offset: nth-child(2n+1)

###Media Queries
- The Baseline:
	+ The mobile phone.
- Start from small layout systems.
- Reduce complexity of presentation as the screen size reduces.

###Responsive Design Makes it Difficult To Write a Fast Website
- The sentiment is false. It is doable.
	+ e.g, The New York Times, [Internet.org](http://internet.org), [Mac Pro product page](http://www.apple.com/mac-pro), all fixed width and heavy in payload.
- The responsive design experience is going to be dependent on how well it is architected and how assets/resources are engineered into efficiency.

###Demographics are going to make delivering responsive content to devices across the globe a challenge.
- Particularly second and third world nations, where the great majority of users are mobile users, some using protocols aside from HTTP.
- These demographics are going to become our users.
- _7 billion_ mobile subscriptions worldwide.
	+ 60% are still on _2G Data Networks!_

###How can we promote the health of the web?
- The sustainability of web design.
	+ Planning responsibly for the sustainable growth of the web:
		* Reduce
			- Reduce load times by slimming assets.
			- Offload resources to CDNs (e.g., [CDNJS](http://cdnjs.com)/[CloudFlare](http://cloudflare.com))
			- [microjs](http://microjs.com)
			- Consider page weight, but also sub-3G network performance.
		* Revisit
			- Progressive Enhancement
			- _All_ users are non-JS users until JS has downloaded.
			- A new definition of beautiful.
				+ How broadly it can be accessed.
				+ How it can change over time.

##DAY II
###(10/28/14)
-------

##Enhance! by Jeremy Keith ([@adactio](http://twitter.com/adactio))

###Perspective/Rewire Your Brain
- You can't _not_ see the arrow in the FedEx logo.
- You can't _not_ see the bear in the Toblerone logo.
- [All ducks are wearing dog masks!](http://ubersuper.com/all-ducks-are-wearing-dog-masks)

###The Mediums Before and Standards
- "'[Killer Web Sites](http://www.amazon.com/Creating-Killer-Sites-David-Siegel/dp/1568304331)' are usually those which tame the wildness of the web, constraining pages as if they were made of paper - Desktop Publishing for the Web." - John Allsopp
	+ He was referring to making web pages less static, and not like the printed page.
	+ It takes time for new mediums to develop themselves and their own vocabulary.
- Web Standards Project was instrumental in convincing browser developers and web developers to follow a set of standards.
	+ Separating concepts from each other: Structure (HTML) separate from presentation (CSS), and from behavior (JavaScript).
- Shearing Layers:
	+ Buildings:
		* Stuff, space plan, services, skin, structure, site.
	+ Web:
		* URL, protocol, HTML, CSS, JavaScript.

###HTML is Fault Tolerant
- HTML is designed to tolerate faults. Unknown tags do not throw errors, it just shows the content. It ignores the stuff it doesn't understand, and carries on rendering.
- This behavior allows us to add new elements when we need them (e.g., <article>, <nav>, <header>, <footer>, et cetera).
	+ Older browsers won't throw errors on these "unknown" elements.
- Structural Honesty:
	+ <table> shouldn't be used for layout, it isn't structurally honest. Use for tabular data.
	+ Use <button> for buttons. Not <span> or <a>.

###CSS is Fault Tolerant
- Anatomy:
	+ Selector
	+ Property
	+ Value
- If a browser doesn't understand a selector, it ignores the entire block.
	+ What it doesn't do, is throw an error to the user. This, again, allows CSS to expand to embrace new elements in the future as it evolves.
	+ Similarly, it ignores invalid properties!
- Material Honesty:
	+ If you want something to have rounded corners, you'd use [border-radius](http://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/b/border-radius), not use images to shim a button to achieve the desired effect.
	+ Use [CSS gradients](http://css-tricks.com/css3-gradients), not images!

###JavaScript is _not_ fault tolerant!
- Error handling is necessary for JavaScript to evaluate properly and execute. It will throw an error if something is wrong, and halt execution.
	+ This necessitates "sale defaults". Use JavaScript, but don't ultimately rely on it, use as an enhancement.
- Build things that will degrade gracefully.
	+ Good example of bad stuff. Instagram won't even load if JavaScript is disabled!
- We should account for people who not able to parse JavaScript. It's a small number, but should be accounted for. And the number accumulates over time.

###Progressive Enhancement
- It is more robust to build for people who may not be able to have access to all features.
- Build with features lowest in the stack (HTML/CSS), rather than highest in the stack. _Then_ add your glitter and rainbows in the higher segment of the stack (JavaScript).
- "Be conservative in what you send, be liberal in what you accept." - The [Robustness Principle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robustness_principle), by Jon Postel.

###Design Principles
- Principles of design apply to all situations:
	+ Even a country (Declaration of Independence).
	+ The robot code by Isaac Asimov.
- You cannot help but imbue your ideas and principles into software that you build.
	+ Photoshop imbues its own ideas of what a document is-- And it isn't meant for web design.
- All software is opinionated to a lesser or greater degree.
- Occam's Razor: Wait until you need a tool like [Modernizr](http://modernizr.com) or [jQuery](http://www.jquery.com) before you add it to your imports.
- Does the philosophy of a framework match YOUR philosophy?
	+ Is it at odds with how you work, or not?
- "No one wants to think that what they're doing is trivial." - John Resig (creator of [jQuery](http://www.jquery.com))
	+ No one wants to admit that what they do isn't difficult and requires a lot effort. "This IS really hard to do! _YEAH!_"
	+ Do you need to tie yourself to the mast of a particular framework? Like [Angular](https://angularjs.org), [Backbone](http://backbonejs.org) or [Ember](http://emberjs.com/)?

###The Web "Platform"
- "JavaScript is part of the web platform; You don't get to take it away and expect the web to work." - Tom Dale (Creator of Ember)
	+ He's right and wrong; It depends on how you frame the context in which you see the web.
- Some of our language obfuscates reality. Examples:
	+ The Cloud? You mean _THE INTERNET?_
	+ Flash vs. Web vs. Native app (iOS/Android).
		* Flash and native platforms are all or nothing. You either get all of it or none of it.
		* But the web is meant to be accessed by everything and everyone with a device. You may not get all of the bells and whistles, but you'll get _something_.
- You can't get the same feature set from the web that you get from a native app, but the web is designed for accessibility, not for luxury.
	+ Swipe, scroll, tap, drag _vs._ Find, publish, share, buy. All platforms allow for it. The web just gives this ability to everyone, regardless of user agent.

###Web Sites vs. Web Apps
- They're all web sites. A web application is a web page that fulfills a certain function, it's not like you're writing desktop software.
- A web app is a website that stops working when JavaScript isn't available (tongue-in-cheek).
- Passive vs. Interactive behaviors
	+ Reading = Passive
		* Skills: Typography, color, layout
	+ Buying, building lists, managing users.
		* Skills: Animation, timing, MVC.
	+ Truth is, all "apps" or web pages require a mixture of all these elements.

###Rewiring Our Brains
- This is what Responsive Web Design has done. It has taken us from the days of fixed layouts, and made us look at what we do differently.
- Responsive Web Design and Progressive Enhancement and two sides of the same code. Case in point:
	+ Semantic markup without any CSS is technically responsive. It flows to the width of the viewport.
- Using structurally honest markup and making good semantic markup decisions will _keep your website accessible!_

###[Do websites need to look exactly the same in every browser?](http://dowebsitesneedtolookexactlythesameineverybrowser.com/)
- **NO!**

###A Pattern of Enhancement
- Make sure all the stuff works without all the fancy scripts. Then add in your fancy stuff when the basic stuff works.
- Use feature detection, _not_ browser detection.
- "There is a difference between support and optimization." - Brad Frost
	+ Sites should work in older browsers, not be optimized for older browsers.

###It is possible to change behavior.
- The solution is to change the expectations of clients and bosses, not to accommodate the same behavior for every single platform.

##The Developer's Ampersandwich by Jenn Lukas ([@jennlukas](http://twitter.com/jennlukas))

###Layer I: The Sturdy Bottom Bun
- Designers must have developers understand design intentions.
- Developers love formulas.
- Some typography is web safe (Times New Roman, Arial), other fonts aren't (Helvetica).
- Solutions?
	+ Historical:
		* Image headlines
		* Sifr
		* Cufon
	+ Now:
		* **@font-face**!
- Web safe fonts -> Web font trends
	+ [Google Fonts](http://google.com/fonts), sort by Popularity.
	+ [Fonts.com blog](http://blog.fonts.com)
	+ [Adobe Typekit](http://typekit.com) shows the most favorited fonts.
- Tools:
	+ [FontSquirrel](http://fontsquirrel.com)
	+ [WhatFont Chrome Plugin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/whatfont/jabopobgcpjmedljpbcaablpmlmfcogm?hl=en)

###Layer II: General Cheese
- Use style guides, pattern libraries and general styles to create a harmonious system.
- The general styles make sure no element goes un-styled.
- Created with a separate document containing every HTML document.

###Layer III: Web Fonts Burger
- Web fonts changed everything.
- **BEWARE:** Cross browser differences.
	+ All browsers render a little different. &nbsp; elements may not render as spaces. Weights could be different.
- Set aside the time and budget for thorough QA testing.
- Make sure your fonts will work for your audience _before_ design approval.
- Chrome on windows renders fonts poorly vs. Chrome on mac.
	+ [Typekit](http://typekit.com) has a browser rendering preview to see how fonts will look on different browsers.
- Monitor how fonts affect your page speed.
	+ The size of fonts are important to the payload weight of a page, and thus performance.
- Just because I can do something, should I?
	+ **NOPE.**
- [Google Fonts](http://google.com/fonts) has a meter to let you know what the payload weight of using the web fonts are.
	+ [Typekit](http://typekit.com) also has a similar warning if you're adding a lot of weight to your page.
- Media Queries can be used to restrict when an asset is delivered to a user's browser.
- Fallback fonts are necessary, so default to web safe (near) equivalent.
	+ [FFFFALLBACK](http://ffffallback.com) is a good tool to show web-safe equivalents.
	+ [Tinytype](http://www.jordanm.co.uk/tinytype) has a comprehensive table of good fallbacks as well.
- Will the cost be approved?
	+ If not, free fonts have come a long way.
		* [The League of Moveable Type](https://www.theleagueofmoveabletype.com)
		* [FontSquirrel](http://fontsquirrel.com)
		* [Google Fonts](http://google.com/fonts) (of course)
		* [Adobe Edge Web Fonts](https://edgewebfonts.adobe.com)

###Layer III: Icon Fonts Bacon
- Using font icons for common iconography:
	+ Social icons
	+ Add/substract, other symbols.
- Services:
	+ [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io) <- Free
	+ [Symbolset](http://symbolset.com) <- Paid
- Consider using CDNs, unless too many extra server calls are being made.
- Icon fonts mean no more image sprites.
- We can apply CSS transforms to these icon fonts.
- Icon fonts are ideal for retina displays.
- You can also make your own icon fonts.
	+ [Glyphsapp](http://glyphsapp.com)
	+ [Icomoon](http://icomoon.io)
		* But what about SVGs? You can use Icomoon to generate SVGs or PNGs rather than font files.
		* Compatibility all the way down to IE8 for icon fonts, whereas SVGs don't have support until IE9.

###Layer IV: Accesilettuce
- Keep screen readers out of things you don't want read by adding [aria-hidden](http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/states_and_properties#aria-hidden) to tags you don't want read.
- You can use fonts that replace an entire word to get around the screen reader problem.
- Contrast is important for people with potentially poor vision.
	+ Use [webaim](http://webaim.org) to help with contrast checking.
- Use ems/rems for sizing of fonts.
	+ rems are more useful, because they lessen the compounding of calculations by only looking at the <body> tag's font-size value.
- Make sure color contrast meets the 4.5:1 WCAG requirement.

###Layer V: Typecastomato
- Use [Typecast](http://typecast.com) to share font styles with your team.
	+ Great setting up type systems in Photoshop.

###Layer VI: Little Onions
- Identify pain points for your team to overcome them.
	+ Plan your designs for variable content.
- Update often. Share your passwords to services so that redundant purchases aren't being made.
- Use [-webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased;](http://css-tricks.com/beefing-up-dull-text-in-webkit) _cautiously_. It can have wider reaching consequences than you might expect.
- Test in your _least favorite_ browser! If it looks good in a terrible browser, it will look good across the board!
- [Type Rendering Mix](http://typerendering.com) fixes text rasterization issues.
	+ But it adds page weight, so use sparingly.
- Limit your font sizes. Do a type size audit.
	+ [Typo-o-matic](http://type-o-matic.com) is a tool to audit your font type sizes/variants.

###Layer VII: Ka-raaaaaaaazy sauce
- We can use webkit masking for interesting effects.
- Use [background-clip](http://css-tricks.com/transparent-borders-with-background-clip) for other effects!
- Text rotation for special effects.
	+ Arbitrary rotations create cool effects.
- Face tracking for text size.
- **Share all the knowledge:**
	+ Lunch and Learns
	+ Knowledge Shares
	+ Book Clubs

###Layer VIII: Quality Assurance Bun
- Schedule internal design reviews with your _whole team_.

##Content in Context is King by Derek Featherstone [@feather](http://twitter.com/feather)

###Anticipation is Part of Creating Great Experiences.
- Context is often seen as a device thing.
- Needs, Wants, Emotions and Stereotypes: The emotional compass.

###What Defines Context?
- What resolutions do we design for?
	+ **All of them.**
- But resolution is only one piece for creating responsiveness.
- Example of copy out of context: "Please complete the form to the right:" in a mobile context where the form is actually not to the right. Poor context. Copy needs to be refactored.
- Device is only part of the context, though.
	+ Time
		* Developing dynamic CTAs that respond to the context of time (e.g., event registration CTA should change the day of, or when it is sold out.)
		* Showing the schedule as the landing page on the day of a particular event, rather than making a person dig into the site.
		* Developing a context map to show content priority over time:
			- Pre-Event (Sort of important)
				+ Tweets: Build-up.
				+ Logistics and Sell: Important!
			- Event (Very important)
				+ Tweets: Live tweeting.
				+ Logistics and Sell: Less important.
			- Post-Event (Not very important at all)
				+ Tweets: Quite important. Wanted to show off and encourage future attendees.
				+ Logistics and Sell: Not at all important.
			- **Apply these concepts in a way that are specific to your application or event!**
	+ Location
		* On the day of the event, you'll get the schedule, but there are also event details that we can deliver to a user if they're at the event. You can deliver useful info to users based on their location.
		* You could combine this aspect with time to fine tune content delivery for people.
	+ Proximity
		* Related to location, but finer-grained and contextual to where users are to one another. Are they on campus? Are they in a particular room?
		* Using location or proximity to change the presentation and configuration of common UI utilities (datepicker starts on Sunday in the US, but on Monday in other places.)
		* How devices alert you based on your location (e.g., I'm logged in to my computer, don't send notifications to my phone and tablet.)
	+ State of Mind
		* Setting up the interface to discourage interaction perhaps if a user's state of mind tends to be the same at a certain time of day.
	+ Capabilities
		* Fine motor control problems could necessitate UI adjustments.
		* Low-vision users.
	+ Activity
		* [Google Maps](http://maps.google.com) navigation, for instance, changes map scale based on speed.
	+ Interests
		* Changing the display to show the information the user is interested in. For instance, show the departure time of a flight if that's what a user wants to know, rather than price or shortest flight.
	+ Interaction

##WARNING!
- Users have a sort of muscle memory with websites. We expect things to be in certain places. Be careful with how you shuffle your content. (Don't move your nav or something like that if a context changes.)
- All context must be resettable. You need to allow people to opt out of context-specific experiences.
	+ Tracking specifically needs to allow users to opt out. Facebook Timeline is a good example of this.

##Co-Design, Not Redesign by Kevin M. Hoffman [@kevinmhoffman](http://twitter.com/kevinmhoffman)

###File Sharing & Repositories Are Not Collaboration
- These tools are for workflow.
- We used to use email for all workflow, but now we rely on smarter tools.
	+ Google InBox.
- Collaboration happens when the whole is greater than the sum.
	+ Real time meetings can lead to successful collaboration.
- Meetings can be a force for evil.
	+ They can lead to design by committee.
	+ They can slow down a process.

###Co-Design
- _Not redesign._ Redesign is overhaul. Co-design involves collaborative efforts from users, clients and developers.
- Anyone adding value **is** collaboration.
- "The bottleneck is never code or creativity. It's clarity." - Scott Berlun, The Year Without Pants
	+ Clarity about what people are doing, and _why_ they are doing those things.
- Problem: "We aren't sure how to prioritize our content in a responsive design."
	+ Old Way: Ping designs back and forth and work through feedback.
	+ New Way (Co-design):
		* Broke the page into pieces (a content model), and put them on 3"x5" cards.
		* Had 20 people, editors, journalists, et cetera, and broke them into groups.
		* Limited them to five cards, and pick the five you like and sort them by importance.
		* Built the responsive wireframes based on the input from the research group.

###Design the Meetings
1. Say yes to the first meeting.
2. If a second meeting is required, a question of "what decisions do we need to make?"
	+ If no, another meeting was not needed, but a consensus on decisions was needed.
	+ Who will add value to these decisions?
		* Developers?
		* Stakeholders?
		* Other functions of the business?
	+ Great meetings start with **clear objectives**.
	+ Plan meetings around **decisions** first, not people.

###Iterating
- Constantly create new topics centered around your project.
- Get a group of people to generate ideas and select the creme de la creme.
- Tangents are okay, because the solution exists inside of that space, but the end result has to go back into a cohesive decision making process, rather than abject chaos.
	+ In summary, divergent thinking, back into convergent thinking.
- You can keep 3 to 5 complex ideas at once in the brain. Additional ideas will eliminate older ideas.
- Two ways to design meetings:
	+ Plan outcomes
	+ Give room for ideas to breathe.
- But _mistakes will be made!_
	+ Assumptions get made that are false, but with co-design, they can be remedied prior to execution.
	+ Your customer will likely be the one to point out shortcomings in your product.
- "We have an excellent website and some ideas but we aren't sure what to build for mobile." - WHYY
	+ A design test is built:
		* At first, you work by yourself and determine theories and form a hypothesis.
		* You break up the primary group into smaller groups and let them all iterate until all converge on a much smaller set of ideas.
	+ Giving a client access to the co-design process generated ideas to create a solution.
	+ Someone in the group should be a facilitator, someone who is neutral, doesn't provide ideas, and manages people in the design meeting.
		* This person should be a subject matter expert, and conduct one-on-one interviews with design meeting attendees.
	+ Become an expert. Then facilitate a productive conversation.
- Public Recording.
- Visual Agenda.
	+ 24 hour circle represents the meeting length.
- Critical ideas are lost if you don't engage visually.
- Visually represent agenda, conflicts & key decisions.
- Way to provide **access to process**:
	+ Neutral, informed facilitation.
	+ Use visuals for agenda, conflicts, decisions and concepts.

###Transparency About Risks
- Empathy comes from being transparent.
	+ Transparent about risks, and how bad outcomes can come about.
- Focus relentlessly on the job that is to be done by the product/application.
	+ Generate a theory of how a problem can be solved.
	+ Test the theory.
	+ Gather the results.
	+ If successful, further refine and deliver.
	+ Shorter & measurable experiments focus on results.
- "What assumptions do we hold that if proven wrong, could cause the product to fail?"
- Being transparent about the outcomes is what will help to ensure a good outcome.
- "Sharing is Influence"
- [ExperimentCalculator](http://experimentcalculator.com)

###Meetings Are Things That Can Be Designed.
- We can design meetings by thinking about the outcomes they can have.
- How we can arrive to conclusions via divergent and convergent thinking.
- Access to the process opens up the floor for your target audience to have influence on the product's development.
- Being transparent about the risks with your clients, stakeholders and end users will help to ensure a better outcome.

##Touchy Subjects: Creating Content for Sensitive Situations by Kate Kiefer Lee ([@katekiefer](http://twitter.com/katekiefer))

###Take Your Natural Empathy and Translate It To The Page
- Readers have their own personalities, circumstances, feelings, values and tendencies.

###Touchy Subjects
- Healthcare, Medicine, Hospice.
- Money and Banking.
- Fundraising (political, Kickstarter, non-profits.)
- Religion and Politics (naturally.)

###Messaging
- Urgent Messaging
	+ Time-sensitive.
	+ Bad news
	+ Apologies
- Less Urgent
	+ Help Docs.
	+ Customer Service Emails.
	+ Contact Pages.
	+ Forms.
	+ Unsubscribe Pages.
	+ Legal Policies.

###Map Your Touchy Subjects
- Make a list of all your content types.
	+ Then pull out whatever types seem like urgent messaging.
- Articulating Feelings:
	+ Needs Are Being Met
		* Amused
		* Confident
		* Encouraged
		* Happy
		* Enthusiastic
	+ Needs Are Not Being Met
		* Aggravated
		* Angry
		* Mad
		* Frustrated
		* Hesitant
		* Disappointed
- Tone
	+ Confronting Negative Emotions:
		* Adopt positive and helpful tone.

###Principles:
1. Be clear.
2. Get to the point.
3. Stay calm.
	+ Avoid certain words: "Immediately", "Critical", et cetera.
4. Be serious.
	+ Don't adopt your normally fun and playful performance to sensitive situations.
5. Be nice.
	+ Think about your pronouns, and generally measure your words.

###Read Your Copy Out Loud
- Helps you to examine your tone and whether it is congruent with your message.
- Puts your empathy into what you're saying.
- Helps to catch typos and errors.

###Avoid Extremes in Tone
- Do not overly formalize your tone.
- On the other hand, don't overly trivialize your tone for the subject matter.
- Strike a balance.

###Customer Service Messages
- Usually customer service is engaged when a user is stressed or frustrated.
	+ The corresponding tone should be friendly and understanding, but do not overly formalize your tone.
- Canned messages should sound human, not robotic or stiff.
- Help Doucments are places people go when they need answers fast.
	+ Clear and specific titles.
	+ Avoid vague language.
	+ Consistent style and format (lists, paragraphs, text formatting, et cetera.)
	+ Walk customers through processes.

###Contact Pages and Forms
- People may feel curious, confused, anticipatory.
	+ So we want to respond in an approachable, friendly and informative fashion.
- Reduce the amount of contact fields.
	+ Bad examples:
		* [Chik-Fil-A contact page](http://www.chick-fil-a.com/Connect/Contact-Us-CARES). Too many fields! It's as if they are simply trying to get us to give up.
		* [Apple's contact page](http://www.apple.com/contact). Just a big info dump. You can get what you need, but it isn't optimal.
		* [Woot's contact page](http://www.woot.com/write-us). "Fun", but ultimately discouraging copy, because the tone of the copy is not changed to accommodate the needs of the user's potential mood..
	+ Good example:
		* [NYC's official contact page](http://www1.nyc.gov/home/contact-us.page).

###Unsubscribe Pages
- You're already on thin ice if a user wants to unsubscribe.
- Users are feeling annoyed or frustrated by your unwanted solicitation.
	+ Respond warmly and with an understanding tone.
	+ Or use it as an opportunity to win them back.
- Good examples:
	+ [Obama's re-election unsubscribe page](http://www.barackobama.com/unsubscribe).
		* They show understanding, and validate feelings.
		* Offer to send viewer emails, rather than none at all.
	+ Photojojo: ["We're sad to see you go."](http://photojojo.com/unsubscribe)
		* After unsubscribing, they give options to follow on social media and alternative ways to get info from them.
- Bad examples:
	+ Mitt Romney's unsubscribe page immediately unsubscribes users, and uses an oddly enthusiastic tone to thank a user for unsubscribing, rather than trying to offer a remedy.

###Social Media (A Touchy Subject)
- Antagonistic conversations can happen on social media.
	+ We counteract with a direct and friendly message.
- Avoid redundant words in copy, or being too lighthearted. Especially in situations where service downtime is the central issue.
- What not to do: Charmin tweeting about the Aurora, CO shooting incident, coming off delusional about their place in consumers' lives.

###Legal Policies
- Users are apprehensive, confused and potentially vigilant.
- Respond with a serious, thorough, yet calm tone, because you want to allay suspicions and fears about your practices.
- Write in plain language if you can, but legalese does have its place in protecting a company.
- Good example: Editorially.
	+ Simple, clear definitions about the terminology of their contract.

###Apologies
- Fallibility means we're going to have to apologize at some point. Possible situations requiring an apology might be:
	+ Data breach.
	+ CEO goofs up and says something stupid.
	+ Someone tweets through an official account when they meant to tweet through their personal.
	+ Extended downtime.
- Users are going to be angry, disappointed and anticipatory of a response.
	+ The corresponding tone should be warm, honest and contrite.
- Bad example: Airlines.
- Good example: [The Atlantic, 2013, in response to a Scientology ad](https://www.magnetmail.net/actions/email_web_version.cfm?recipient_id=699462885&message_id=2459857&user_id=NJG_Atlan&group_id=0&jobid=12656579).
- Prepare for the worst! Because you're going to goof something up some day, so be prepared on how to respond confidently, and in the proper tone.
- Templates:
	+ Possible content types.
		* Email, tweet, blog post, et cetera.
	+ Apologize up front if necessary.
	+ Say what happens next.
	+ Who the message will be from.
	+ Who needs to sign off.
- Emergency Contact List
	+ Managers and subject matter-experts.
	+ Phone and email info.
	+ Approvals.
	+ Legal counsel.

###How To Teach These Concepts
- Use a style guide.
	+ A matrix of Content Type, Reader's Feelings and Tone (Map Content Types.)
	+ Organize your style guide by areas of message types (compliance alerts, failure messages, blog, public site, et cetera.) and how that relates to the tone of voice you need to adapt for each message type.

##Content in a Zombie Apocalypse by Karen McGrane ([@karenmcgrane](http://twitter.com/karenmcgrane))

###Print
- Everything stems from the invention of scribing ink on paper.

###Web
- Created with the idea that any document could be accessed anywhere and be updated instantaneously.

###Mobile/Tablets and The Next Big Thing.
- Mobile forces us to confront how the web is changing. We have no control over the device, and we must adapt to it.
- How do we treat what we publish knowing there is no primary output.
- There are devices we don't anticipate (SmartTV?)
- Possible devices on the horizon (In-Car?)
- Wearables (Google Glass.)
- Smart Watches.
- There will be more sensors and screens in the home that will deliver content in the future.
- Toaster printers?!

###Delivering Content to a Wider Variety of Devices
- Content truly needs to be separated from presentation in order to achieve dissemination of content to a wide variety of devices.
- The web can do more than print.

###Blobs vs. Chunks
- Blobs are globs of markup and content mixed in.
	+ PDFs. They are pieces of paper on the internet.
		* How to take types of content (charts/graphs) and appropriate them into a CMS.
	+ Content producers are attached to these formats because they are familiar.
	+ Cost of migrating this content to simple text is prohibitively costly and takes a long, long time.
- Chunks are discrete pieces of content and meta data.
- Container-first thinking.
	+ How big do I want the thing to be?
	+ RWD: Identifying common breakpoints.
	+ Cards for content vs. pages.

###Content Modeling
- The structure, size and shape of content before it is designed.
- Dissemination of content via APIs to discrete applications.
- Anatomy:
	+ Type of Content:
		* Article, product spec, recipe, medical condition, radio program.
	+ Attributes of Content Type (Recipe, for instance):
		* Ingredients, steps, name.
- The challenge is figuring out how to aggregate these disparate types of content.

###Our Future Depends on Making Data More Discrete, Segmented, Fielded and _Structured_.
- By segmenting our data, we can break it out into forms that are more easily consumed by discrete applications, rather than aggregating them within more inconvenient forms.

##DAY III
###(10/29/14)
-------

##Screen Time by Luke Wroblewski ([@lukew](http://twitter.com/lukew))

###Corning invented synthetic ceramic glass in 1952 (Project 0317)
- This became Gorilla glass, used on iPhones.
	+ Used on 1.5 billion consumer devices, expected to double in the next year.
- "We care about the display because we know that's the window to the software." - Tim Cook, CEO of Apple.
- Online time is screen time.

###Boiling it Down
1. Know Your Screen
	+ **There are many devices and insane variability between them**
		* But we don't need to know the parameters of every single device. Just a few things.
		* The highest device usage is medium-sized smart phones, like iPhones and Androids.
		* PCs staying where they're at, and tablets steadily growing in use.
2. Output
	+ Not just the size, but the resolution of the screen is important." - Tim Cook
	+ DPI Trends
		* PCs: 100ppi
		* Mobile: 200ppi
			- Retina: 326ppi
			- Galaxy S4: _441ppi_
			- LG Optimus Quad HD: **_538ppi_**
		* Ultra HD Monitor (4K)
		* Retina 5K Display: _1.5 million_ pixels!
	+ Use CSS and web type whenever possible.
	+ Use SVG and icon fonts whenever possible.
	+ Leverage media queries to deliver assets for appropriate screen densities.
	+ Aspect ratio is important!
	+ On short and wide screens, you can make use of min-height to accommodate and truncate white space.
3. Input
	+ Touch screen revenue is increasing along with its global square footage.
	+ Multiple inputs of touch screens.
		* Some can be augmented with keyboards and cursors.
	+ Support _all_ of the inputs.
	+ Media Queries Level 4
		* Pointer: Input type being used.
			- Mouse
			- Finger
			- Stylus
		* Hover: Will the hover pseudo-class work on the current device.
	+ Screen size is a poor proxy, but it's all we got for now.
4. Posture
	+ How people interact with output and input.
	+ Screen distance can determine input and output experience.
		* 18" experience?
		* 24" experience?
		* et cetera.
	+ The general feeling is that you add 1/2" to box display per foot of distance.
	+ Screen size is a poor proxy for posture.
	+ light-level is a proposed part of Media Queries Level 4.

##Designing for Crisis by Eric Meyer [@meyerweb](http://twitter.com/meyerweb)

###In a Crisis, How Content is Arranged is _Critical_.
- For mobile users, a desktop experience is unacceptable.
	+ Not all users are perfect, focused people with no distractions. Content should be streamlined so the least focused users can find their way.
- Remove unnecessary and impractical content that just gets in the way, in case a user in crisis is visiting and _just needs to know what to do, **because they don't know!**_
	+ If a frightened, shattered user can understand your content, then _every_ user will be able to understand, too!
- Presenting content that is incongruent to a user's mood can add to feelings of disorientation.
- A contextual crisis can also occur: "We thought we were registered, but we don't have a record of it!"
	+ Make it easy to resolve these contextual crises.
	+ Getting across the airport with a short connection time.
- Filtering down to only the most relevant data that a user needs. Avoid clutter.
	+ Airline booking sites doing it wrong: Almost all of them.
	+ Airline booking site doing it right: [Hipmunk](http://hipmunk.com)
- Provide meaningful feedback.
	+ Use current technologies (Not Java or Flash applets.)
	+ Use meaningful error messaging if something has gone awry.
		* "An Error Occurred" is the opposite of meaningful.

###Designing for Crisis Success Story
- A fear of the unfamiliar needs to be mitigated with cues that a scenario is actually safe.
- GE Healthcare focuses on making medical imaging seem more inviting, imparting a sense of safety, maybe even adventure for their hospital.
	+ Minimal design cut CT sedation rates by _96% in two years_.
	+ Wait time for elective CT scanning went from 17 days to _0 days_ over two years.
	+ This is all due to minimal effort of design.
- Design by committee can work. Solo efforts are not the only way to accomplish good design.
- Simulate a crisis scenario by using CSS animations and transforms to blur and make a testable case for crisis situations for users in a normal user.

###In Conclusion
- Diversify personas.
- Diversify contexts.
- Consider when pieces of your experience fail.
	+ Slow bandwidth.
	+ JavaScript fails.
	+ Applets fail (don't use applets.)
- Create crisis test scenarios using CSS techniques.

###You Can Help Ease A User's Crisis by Informing Your Design and Content Delivery With These Techniques!

##The Elusive, Inclusive Web App (or Thang) by Scott Jehl [@scottjehl](http://twitter.com/scottjehl)

###"App"
- We tend think of native apps (iOS/Android).
	+ Facebook
- Once inside of an app, sometimes there's more apps within the app.

###"Web App"
- It doesn't mean much about what it is, but what it isn't.
- "It gives them a 'get out of jail free' card for bad, exclusive practices." - Jeremy Keith on the term.
- "The Cloud" means nothing. Might as well be "The Butt".
	+ WhatButt plugin for Chrome (hilarious!)
- Call it a thang.

###Access is The Greatest Reason to Build on the Web
- Inclusiveness is inherent to the web.
	+ An app store can't really be described that way.
- Access is a business opportunity.
- Much of the world's web traffic this year will come from cheaper, under-featured devices in emerging markets (e.g.,developing countries.)

###Building Inclusively
- Responsive design is responsible design.
	+ But it doesn't cover everything, and it doesn't claim to.
	+ But we use it to hit all devices with a single semantic structure.

###_Weight_ Does Not Need to Increase _Wait_
- The way we deliver assets almost matters more than what we deliver.

###Prioritizing Access & Performance
- Speed broadens access.
- Serve functional HTML.
	+ Critical JavaScript
	+ Critical CSS
	+ Offline manifest reference
		* Capability to work offline
	+ _Real functional HTML content!_
- Focusing on perceived performance.
- Obstacles on the critical path:
	+ <link> and external <scripts>
		* These can block rendering, but with CSS, this is preferred to prevent the flash of unstyled content.
		* But too many requests can introduce failure points.
		* JavaScript should be pushed later (in the foot of the document.)
	+ Lessen the weight of assets
		* Minification
			- HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SVG.
		* Concatenating Files
			- CSS and JavaScript in particular.
			- Image sprites.
		* Gzip
			- Compress text assets.
- Then we can get off the critical path.
	+ Webpagetest can be used to test pages from discrete locations and simulate test cases.
	+ Sub-1 Second Start-Render (Or, the first 14kb)
		* Google PageSpeed Insights.
			- Reduce render blocking scripts in above-the-fold content.
			- Detect above-the-fold critical CSS (Google that and link it, dude.)
				+ Open Source projects by the Filament Group
					* Grumpicon, for example.
					* [grunt-criticalcss](https://github.com/filamentgroup/grunt-criticalCSS) package for the [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com) CLI is a tool to accomplish critical CSS parsing.
			- Inline the critical JavaScript
				+ What is critical? Ideally nothing at all, but some options:
					* Feature tests (Modernizr).
					* HTML5 shiv?
					* A file-loading function for additional assets
					* Conditional logic for loading files. Any kind of file! CSS or JavaScript.
- Apply progressive enhancements:
	+ [Shoestring](https://github.com/filamentgroup/shoestring): A library on a budget. A simple DOM toolkit with jQuery syntax. Good enough until it's not.
	+ Optimizing for touch.
		* Layer interactivity. _Don't replace it.__
	+ Normalize input handling.
		* [Tappy!](https://github.com/filamentgroup/tappy) A lightweight normalized tap event.
- Making Navigation _Seamless_.
	+ Consider renegotiating a contract if transition-handling is going to be part of the deal.
	+ But if you're going to do it...
		* Use Client-Side MVC?
			- React
			- Ember
			- Backbone
			- Angular
		* What is MVC?
			- Model
			- View
			- Controller
		* Progressive Enhancement _and_ MVC?
	+ A Poor Dev's Client-Server MVC:
		1. API emits data in JSON.
		2. Server combines JSON + mustache, outputs HTML.
		3. Functional HTML is delivered to browser.
		4. CSS+JS add visual and interactive enhancements.
		5. JS fetches all app data + templates.
		6. All further updates and navigation can be handled with JS.
	+ Instead of "DOM Ready", Enhance:
		* $(document).bind("**enhance**", function(e){...
		* You can also trigger the event with .trigger("**enhance**");
	+ Maintaining Navigation Parity.
		* Active "page" data-url attribute matches the URI stem (e.g., /home)
	+ history pushstate and popstate _drive the views_.

###Taking Things _Offline_
- The bulk of the work was relatively simple. The starting point is offline appcache:
	+ <html manifest="offline.appcache">
		* Inside the file are directives, that the browser should cache for offline use.
	+ localStorage for data & state.

##How Designers Destroyed the World by Mike Monteiro [@mike_ftw](http://twitter.com/mike_ftw)

###Creation Without Responsibility Breeds Destruction
- A University of Texas student joined a gay chorus group. The group had a Facebook group.
- She had not come out to her parents, so she set up her privacy settings to keep that from her parents.
- Her professor who created the chorus group on Facebook with the default _open setting_. This created a situation where she was suddenly outed by association.
- Her fundamentalist father exploded with homophobic rhetoric.
- The upset of privacy settings is irresponsible design.
- "It's a business decision!" - Bullshit!
	+ Those design decisions make things work in an intended fashion.
	+ Poor design decisions could result in unethical outcomes.
- Someone saw something badly designed and...
	1. They ignored it.
	2. They ran it up the chain.
	3. Chain of command ignored it.
- No one intends to approve bad design.
	+ But sometimes it gets far enough long that they decide that whatever is there is good enough.

###Who can pull the plug on something that sucks?
- Design is nothing short is a human being's attempt to explain our environment.
	+ When design is practiced without responsibility, we get destruction. Not creation.
- "When you see something that is technically sweet, you go ahead and do it and you argue about what to do about it only after you had your technical success." - Oppenheimer on the Atomic Bomb
- We need to fear the consequences of our work more than the fear of getting in trouble.
- We become no better than Death when we are negligent with our design decisions.
- [Victor Papanek](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Papanek), _Badass_:
	+ [Design For the Real World](http://www.amazon.com/s?search-alias=stripbooks&field-isbn=0394470362)
		* First sentence: "There are professions more harmful than industrial design, but only a very few of them.

###We Have a Responsibility for the Havoc Our Designs Can Wreak
- The monsters we unleash will be named after us.
- Shareholder confidence becomes the basis of stupid new inventions.
- Making rich people richer is not disruption.
- We have more responsibility than we realize.

###We Have a Responsibility to Uphold Our Craft
- We represent each other and our actions can uplift or hold down the members of our craft.

###We Have a Responsibility to Our Clients
- Our clients have problems that need solving, and we have a responsibility to solve the problems.
	+ Even if they are trying to have us do poor work.
	+ Never work for someone you're afraid to say no.
- Tell your client when they have a bad idea.
- "They make me!"
	+ Said every designer and developer ever.
	+ Not a good enough excuse.
- Be willing to get fired.

###We Have a Responsibility to Ourselves
- All personal choices have personal consequences.
- The work we take on defines us.
- If we choose to do work just to keep the lights on, those choices accumulate over time.
	+ Cigarette ads, anyone?

###We've Been Destroying the Wrong Things
1. Destroy Your Ego
	- Respect yourself.
	- Your ego is nothing but fear getting in the way of solutions.
2. Destroy Your Fear
	- Someone is better than you.
	- You will screw up.
	- You will recover from it.
3. Destroy Your Apathy
	- Don't have apathy of you work.
	- Don't do your work without thinking about it.
	- If you don't care, then stop designing.
4. Destroy Petty Authority
	- Don't let people walk all over you.
	- Don't complain and not do anything about it.
5. Destroy the Voice Inside
	- Don't accept less than you're worth.
	- Don't avoid difficult conversations.

##Just Enough Research by Erika Hall [@mulegirl](http://twitter.com/mulegirl)

###Define Your Terms Well
- It helps to weaponize your argument.
- It informs your counter-arguments.

###Wanting to Be Right
- You need to ask the right questions, not assert your viewpoint as fact without informing it.
- The world does not conform to any of our preferences.
- Assumptions are risks.

###The Segway Failed
- Because it purported to be so great, but it didn't fit anywhere.
- The research wasn't done, so it became practical and arrogant, because not everyone could afford, and those who could didn't even really want it.

###Research Increases The Chances of Your Product's Success
- We tend to crap on the need to research, but it informs our understanding of a topic.
- "We don't want facts to inhibit creativity." - Said by an idiot.
- "We want blue sky thinking!" - Said by another idiot.
- Those sentiments do not square well with reality.
- "Steve Jobs didn't need to do research." - Incorrect, and it's said out of laziness and fear.

###The Risk of Failure is Dramatically Lower Than It's Ever Been
- Only because failure has become a preferred way of "researching."
- You could just do the research up front. Otherwise it is just gambling.
- Learning by failure leaves needs unmet.
- Don't waste anyone's time or effort on untested assumptions.
- Failure is only the best way to learn if learning otherwise is impossible without first failing.

###Research is a Form of Systematic Inquiry
- It is fundamentally about asking questions...
	+ ...and then forming the best answers you can.
- Pure research:
	+ Science.
	+ Creating new human knowledge.
	+ Experiment and observations.
	+ Peer review.
	+ Rigorous standards and methodologies.
- Applied research serves a specific real world goal:
	+ Improving healthcare.
- Design research is not enough.
	+ You need to look at your organization and users in the context of the real world.

###What Research is Not
- It's one set of inputs, not everything.
- Research is not asking people what they like.
	+ Or what they hate.
- You don't make money from what people are thinking.
	+ You make money from what they do.
- Research is not a political tool used to affirm your flawed ideas to a group of like-minded people.
- Applied research is _not_ science!

###How to Research
1. Form Questions.
	- Good questions are specific, answerable, and practical.
	- Bad example: "What do people think about pets?" - Too generalized.
	- Good example: "How do single urban adults go about acquiring a pet?" - Targeted and relevant to a particular topic.
2. Gather Data.
	- Interview people.
	- Observe people.
3. Analyze Data.

###Research Needs to be a Collaborative Process
- Gather different perspectives without collective assumptions, you can work in a shared reality and converge on ideas (kind of like designing a meeting!)
- Organizational Research:
	+ Requirements.
	+ Politics.
	+ Workflow.
	+ Capabilities.
	+ Goodwill.

###"Why Wasn't I Consulted?"
- Seeking input from the start of a project will prevent you from having an enemy at the end of a project.
- Engage everyone on the basis of their knowledge.

###User Research/Ethnography
- "True ethnography reveals not what people just say they do, but what they actually do."
- The Four Ds:
	1. Deep Dive
	2. Daily Life
	3. Data Analysis
	4. Drama
- Data does not change minds; Stories do.

###Competitive Research
- Essential as it is misunderstood.
	+ Know who your competitors are in the minds of customers, not in your organization's eyes.
- How else might your target customer solve the same problem?
	+ People don't care about the theory of why a product is so great, they care about the actual effect of the product on their lives.
- The hardest competitor is the tendency of people to do nothing. Apathy is tough to overcome. They have to love you more than they hate change.

###Critical Thinking and Interviewing People
- Thinking about thinking. It's self-informative and self-correcting.
	+ Uncritical thinking is snap judgments and personal opinions.
- It's observation, but only ifo you adjust your perceptions to a more objective context.
- "We don't want to be limited by what our customers say they want."
	+ Deal with it. There are more of them than there are of _you._ So interview people.
- Your interview should be less about you talking and more about listening to them.
- Interviewing is uncomfortable, becuase you're trying to get information from people you don't know. But that's how it needs to be, since you are seeking out a perception that is not yours!
	+ So go into the _interviewee's_ comfort zone.

###Analysis
- Analysis is distilling insights from data.
- Have your team analyze the results.
- Actionable inputs: A thing you can do, derived from insights.

###Prototyping
- Don't prototype to sidestep research. It's a hypothesis.
- "The best wine opener in the world doesn't beat the screw-top bottle."
- Make sure you're designing the right product.
- All you can get from a prototype is how well the prototype works. It doesn't address problems that need to be solved.

###Focus Groups Are Not Qualitative Research
- The purpose of ethnographic research is to understand how people operate in the real world.
	+ The focus group environment is _not the real world!_
- The focus group is supposed to be the source of ideas, not the qualitative solution to a problem.
- Focus groups don't have the natural context of a simple interview in a person's own environment (e.g., _their_ context.)

###Quantitative Methods vs Qualitative Methods
- Analytics are great data sources, but they don't inform you on _why_ something works, or what other problems could be lying in wait. They are just quantitative.

###The more people we have asking good questions, the more we all benefit!

###What is "Just Enough"
- Enough to figure out _what problem you're trying to solve._
	+ Needs.
	+ Empathy (with target customers.)
	+ Assess competition.
	+ To be proven wrong as soon as possible, and at the lowest cost.

##How To Champion Ideas Back At Work by Scott Berkun [@berkun](http://twitter.com/berkun)

###The Real Designer is the Person with the Power to Make Decisions
- If you're a champion of your own ideas, you have the authority to manifest the ideas in your head.

###1. The User Experience of User Experience Events
- At the outset of the event, the attention span is highest.
	+ Then eventually it wanes by the end.

###2. Staying Connected Helps You Champion Your Ideas
- Being a champion of creative matters is a social process.
	+ A social network helps people to champion their own ideas and provide prospective.
- When an event is over, your chance to network and connect ends.
- There's no app that will do the network for you.
- Some fun terminology:
	+ **Halfmeet:** A person who you almost started a friendship with at an event.
	+ **Halfhook:** A person you almost hooked up with at an event.
- It's awkward to talk to people you don't know.
- Tips:
	+ Saying "thank you" starts a conversation.
	+ Ask everyone you like for a business card.
	+ Post your notes from sessions during the event. It attracts people to you.
	+ If you use [LinkedIn](http://linkedin.com), write something personal!

###3. What to Champion?
- Events are abstractions, but your life is _specific._
- We are not good at remembering stuff, but our egos are fantastic are great at making us forget that we forget stuff.
	+ The history of eyewitness testimony is lousy.
- Min/Max notetaking: Minimum effort at note taking, maximum effect.
	+ What works best after a talk is a summational activity. To attempt to summarize what you just heard.
- Notetaking summation tips:
	+ 5 bullets per talk. Points or lessons learned.
	+ Note links and references.
	+ Post a summary on your blog (tweet it.)
	+ Post it at work, and share it with your boss.
- Additional benefits:
	+ A simple table. Columns:
		* Lesson Learned.
		* Problems it can solve in my organization.
		* Projects or people with that problem.
	+ Then apply what you learned from the conference to the table for each of the five bullet points per talk.

###4. How to Champion an Idea
- Romanticizing an Idea:
	1. Get Idea.
	2. Build Idea.
	3. Ship It.
- We also romanticize our heros who invent things. But all ideas meet struggles, strife and failure.
- The ideas are romanticized after the fact. No one remembers the struggle to get the idea to be accepted.
- "I could never convince the financiers that Disneyland was feasible, because dreams offer too little collateral." - Walt Disney regarding the realization of Disneyland.
	+ But he perservered, even when his brother was against it. He had media connections and pitched the idea, and attempted to secure funding.
		* And they turned him down.
	+ But then he went to ABC, when it was a fledgling network.
		* Sometimes the front runner isn't always the one that wants any change.
	+ He secured the funding, and then the rest was history.
- You have to convince people of the idea.
	+ Then you have to convince people to build it.
	+ _Then_ you have to convince people to go along with shipping it to the world.
	+ ...And so forth. This is hard to romanticize.

###5. Don't be the guy on the horse when persuading people of your ideas.
- Your bravado is not justified in the real world. It makes you an easy target.
- It's not what you say, it's what people hear.
- Charm (or subtlety) will be the tool you need to persuade people to respect your ideas.
	+ Charm is designed. You craft your message to the person you're trying to persuade (e.g., social engineering), and depends on social context.
	+ Bad: "Here is something you should be doing."
	+ Good: "Here is something that will solve your problem."
		* Know what their problems are, and how to frame and contextualize your idea for someone who is in need of a solution.
		* Frame it in a way that may be of benefit to them.

###6. How to Convince Your Boss
- A: Progress is Change.
- B: Leaders like Status Quo, Resist Change.
- A + B = Leaders resist progress.
- Steps:
	1. Be awesome at your job.
	2. Work with an influential coworker.
		- Your idea may be better served when someone with more clout is a vehicle for it.
	3. Plan a trial, including how to evaluate.
		- Construct an experiment or a A/B test for a small group to see if is viable.
	4. Pitch it.
	5. **DO IT WELL!**
		- If you don't do it well, you may not earn a reputation as a person who can't deliver, and that can foster distrust.
	6. Repeat.

###Now Go Convince People!
